# Machine-Learning---Data-Preprocessing-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

**Objective**
The goal is to understand and apply various data preprocessing techniques and perform exploratory data analysis on a given dataset. You will learn how to clean, transform, and analyze data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights, which are essential steps before building any machine learning model.

**1. Data Cleaning:**
Identify and describe the types of data quality issues present in the dataset. (e.g., missing values, duplicates, outliers).
Implement techniques to handle missing values and justify the chosen methods (e.g., imputation, removal).
Detect and remove duplicate entries in the dataset.

**2. Data Transformation:**
Perform data normalization or standardization where applicable and explain the rationale behind the transformation.

**3. Handling Categorical Data:**
Identify categorical variables in the dataset.
Convert categorical data into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. Explain the impact of these transformations on the dataset.

**4. Feature Engineering:**
Create new features based on existing data that could potentially improve the performance of a machine learning model. Explain your thought process.
Analyze the importance of these new features using correlation or other statistical methods.

**5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Perform univariate analysis on at least three features, including both numerical and categorical features. Visualize and interpret the distributions.
Conduct bivariate analysis to explore relationships between different features. Use visualizations like scatter plots, heatmaps, or pair plots.

**6. Outlier Detection and Handling:**
Identify outliers in the dataset 

**7. Data Visualization:**
Creating meaningful visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, bar charts) to summarize the key findings from EDA. Explaining the insights gained from these visualizations.

**8. Correlation Analysis:**
Calculating the correlation matrix for the numerical features in the dataset. Identify and discuss any strong correlations or lack thereof. How might this influence model selection?
